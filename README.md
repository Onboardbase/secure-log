## Install

To use `log`,

```bash
yarn add @onboardbase/secure-log # npm i @onboardbase/secure-log
```

## Usage

Import the SecureLog library at the **top level** of your project.

**Note**: If you are using any secret manager library (e.g dotenv etc) in your project, you should import those first before importing SecureLog.

```js
import SecureLog from '@onboardbase/secure-log';
new SecureLog(); // For JS projects, use new SecureLog.default()

console.log('random value'); // Onboardbase Signatures here: random value.
```

Then you can use your `console.log` as usual. This should include the `SecureLog` prefix and log your value.

The SecureLog Library also accepts an object.

```js
export default interface IOptions {
  disableOn?: 'development' | 'production'; // You can use this to specify if you want the SecureLog library to be disabled in a specific environment
  disableConsoleOn?: 'development' | 'production'; // You can use this to disable console entirely in a specific environment
}
```

Example:

```js
new SecureLog({ disableConsoleOn: 'development' }); // This will disable the SecureLog library on development environment.
console.log('sensitive secret here'); // This won't be executed.
```

The `disableConsoleOn` option passed to the `SecureLog` library will ensure that the `console.log` statement is not executed.

The `disableOn` && `disableConsoleOn` depends on your `process.env.NODE_ENV` to work perfectly. That is, it compares the environment passed from the `disableOn` || `disableConsoleOn` option with the environment in your `process.env.NODE_ENV` to know when to disable the SecureLog library or the `console` statements itself.

The SecureLog library scans the `arguments` passed to the `console.log` function to check if any of the `...args` inside your `console.log` function is a potential secret. It does this by comparing the `arguments` passed to `console.log` with the values of your current environment: `process.env`. It throws an error if any potential secret is found.

Example:

```js
console.log('secret', process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID); // Onboardbase Signatures here: ************ is a valid secret for the key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
```

This will throw a warning if an actual `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` is found in the `process.env` to notify the user that they are logging a potential secret.

### Supported console methods

The SecureLog library currently only supports these console methods:

- `console.log`, `console.clear`, `console.warn`, `console.profileEnd`, `console.debug`, `console.info`, `console.error`, `console.table`
